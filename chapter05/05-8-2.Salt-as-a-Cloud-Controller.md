# SALT AS A CLOUD CONTROLLER

In Salt 0.14.0, an advanced cloud control system were introduced, allow private cloud vms to be managed directly with Salt. This system is generally referred to as Salt Virt.

The Salt Virt system already exists and is installed within Salt itself, this means that besides setting up Salt, no additional salt code needs to be deployed.

Note

The libvirt python module and the certtool binary are required.

The main goal of Salt Virt is to facilitate a very fast and simple cloud. The cloud that can scale and is fully featured. Salt Virt comes with the ability to set up and manage complex virtual machine networking, powerful image and disk management, as well as virtual machine migration with and without shared storage.

This means that Salt Virt can be used to create a cloud from a blade center and a SAN, but can also create a cloud out of a swarm of Linux Desktops without a single shared storage system. Salt Virt can make clouds from truly commodity hardware, but can also stand up the power of specialized hardware as well.
