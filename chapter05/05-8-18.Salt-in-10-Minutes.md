## GETTING STARTED - 让我们开始吧！
### WHAT IS SALT? - 什么是Salt
Salt是一种不同的基础架构管理方法，其设计思想是在大量系统间高速通信的基础上开辟崭新的管理功能。 这种方法使Salt成为一个强大的多任务系统，可以解决基础设施中的许多特定问题。

Salt的骨干是远程执行引擎，它为一组受管理的系统创建了一个高速、安全和双向的通信网络。 在这个通信系统之上，Salt提供了一个极其快速、灵活且易于使用的配置管理系统，称为`Salt States`。

### INSTALLING SALT - 安装Salt
SaltStack已经变得非常容易安装和开始使用。 [安装文档](https://github.com/watermelonbig/SaltStack-Chinese-ManualBook/blob/master/03.Installation-安装指南.md)包含所有支持平台的说明。

### STARTING SALT - 启动Salt
Salt在master/minion部署架构之上运行。 一个master服务器充当客户端（称为minions）的中央控制总线。 Minions与master建立起连接。

#### SETTING UP THE SALT MASTER - 配置Salt Master服务
打开Salt Master很简单 - 只需启动它！ 默认配置适用于绝大多数安装场景。 Salt Master可以由本地Linux/Unix服务管理器控制：

在基于Systemd的平台上（较新的Debian，openSUSE，Fedora）：
```bash
systemctl start salt-master
```
在基于Upstart的系统上（Ubuntu，旧的Fedora/RHEL）：
```bash
service salt-master start
```
在基于SysV Init 的系统上 (Gentoo, older Debian etc.):
```bash
/etc/init.d/salt-master start
```
或者，可以直接在命令行上启动Master：
```bash
salt-master -d
```
Salt Master也可以在调试模式下在前台启动，从而大大增加了命令输出：
```bash
salt-master -l debug
```
Salt Master需要绑定到系统上的两个TCP网络端口。 这些端口是4505和4506。有关防火墙这些端口的更多信息，可以在[此处](https://github.com/watermelonbig/SaltStack-Chinese-ManualBook/blob/master/chapter05/05-8-7.Opening-the-Firewall-up-for-Salt.md)获得防火墙配置教程。

#### FINDING THE SALT MASTER - 寻找Salt Master
当一个minion启动时，默认情况下它会搜索一个解析为网络上`salt`主机名的系统。 如果找到，则minion将启动与Salt master的握手和密钥身份验证过程。 这意味着最简单的配置方法是设置内部DNS以将名称`salt`解析回Salt Master IP。

否则，需要编辑minion配置文件，以便配置选项`master`指向DNS名称或Salt Master的IP：

> 注意
>
> 配置文件的默认位置是`/etc/salt`。 大多数平台都遵循这一惯例，但FreeBSD和Microsoft Windows等平台将此文件放在不同的位置。

/etc/salt/minion:
```yaml
master: saltmaster.example.com
```

#### SETTING UP A SALT MINION - 配置一个Salt Minion
> 注意
>
> Salt Minion在有或没有Salt Master的情况下都可以运行。 这个教程中是假设minion将连接到master，有关如何运行masterless的minions的信息，请参阅masterless快速入门指南：

[Masterless Minion Quickstart](https://github.com/watermelonbig/SaltStack-Chinese-ManualBook/blob/master/chapter03/03-3.Additional-Installation-Guides-补充安装说明.md#salt-masterless快速使用指南)

现在已经有了master服务，以与master相同的方式启动minion; 使用平台init系统或直接通过命令行：

作为一个后台进程:
```bash
salt-minion -d
```
在前台以调试模式运行:
```bash
salt-minion -l debug
```
当minion启动时，它将生成一个`id`值，除非它在之前的运行中已经生成并缓存（默认情况下在`/etc/salt/minion_id`中）。 这是minion将尝试向master进行身份验证所使用的名称。 尝试以下步骤，以尝试查找不是`localhost`的值：

1. The Python function socket.getfqdn() is run
2. `/etc/hostname` is checked (non-Windows only)
3. `/etc/hosts` (`%WINDIR%\system32\drivers\etc\hosts` on Windows hosts) is checked for hostnames that map to anything within 127.0.0.0/8.

如果以上都不能生成一个不是localhost的id，则检查minion上的IP地址的排序列表（不包括在127.0.0.0/8内的任何内容）。 如果有，则使用第一个可公共路由的IP地址。 否则，使用第一个可以自行路由的IP地址。

如果所有其他方法都失败了，那么`localhost`将用作后备。

> 注意： 关于 Overriding the id
>
> 可以使用minion配置文件中的`id`参数手动指定minion id。 如果指定了此配置值，则它将覆盖id的以上所有其他源。

现在minion启动了，它将生成加密密钥并尝试连接到master。 下一步是返回到master服务器一侧并接受新的minion的公钥。

#### USING SALT-KEY
Salt authenticates minions using public-key encryption and authentication. For a minion to start accepting commands from the master, the minion keys need to be accepted by the master.

The salt-key command is used to manage all of the keys on the master. To list the keys that are on the master:

salt-key -L
The keys that have been rejected, accepted, and pending acceptance are listed. The easiest way to accept the minion key is to accept all pending keys:

salt-key -A
Note

Keys should be verified! Print the master key fingerprint by running salt-key -F master on the Salt master. Copy the master.pub fingerprint from the Local Keys section, and then set this value as the master_finger in the minion configuration file. Restart the Salt minion.

On the master, run salt-key -f minion-id to print the fingerprint of the minion's public key that was received by the master. On the minion, run salt-call key.finger --local to print the fingerprint of the minion key.

On the master:

# salt-key -f foo.domain.com
Unaccepted Keys:
foo.domain.com:  39:f9:e4:8a:aa:74:8d:52:1a:ec:92:03:82:09:c8:f9
On the minion:

# salt-call key.finger --local
local:
    39:f9:e4:8a:aa:74:8d:52:1a:ec:92:03:82:09:c8:f9
If they match, approve the key with salt-key -a foo.domain.com.

SENDING THE FIRST COMMANDS
Now that the minion is connected to the master and authenticated, the master can start to command the minion.

Salt commands allow for a vast set of functions to be executed and for specific minions and groups of minions to be targeted for execution.

The salt command is comprised of command options, target specification, the function to execute, and arguments to the function.

A simple command to start with looks like this:

salt '*' test.version
The * is the target, which specifies all minions.

test.version tells the minion to run the test.version function.

In the case of test.version, test refers to a execution module. version refers to the version function contained in the aforementioned test module.

Note

Execution modules are the workhorses of Salt. They do the work on the system to perform various tasks, such as manipulating files and restarting services.

The result of running this command will be the master instructing all of the minions to execute test.version in parallel and return the result. Using test.version is a good way of confirming that a minion is connected, and reaffirm to the user the salt version(s) they have installed on the minions.

Note

Each minion registers itself with a unique minion ID. This ID defaults to the minion's hostname, but can be explicitly defined in the minion config as well by using the id parameter.

Of course, there are hundreds of other modules that can be called just as test.version can. For example, the following would return disk usage on all targeted minions:

salt '*' disk.usage
GETTING TO KNOW THE FUNCTIONS
Salt comes with a vast library of functions available for execution, and Salt functions are self-documenting. To see what functions are available on the minions execute the sys.doc function:

salt '*' sys.doc
This will display a very large list of available functions and documentation on them.

Note

Module documentation is also available on the web.

These functions cover everything from shelling out to package management to manipulating database servers. They comprise a powerful system management API which is the backbone to Salt configuration management and many other aspects of Salt.

Note

Salt comes with many plugin systems. The functions that are available via the salt command are called Execution Modules.

HELPFUL FUNCTIONS TO KNOW
The cmd module contains functions to shell out on minions, such as cmd.run and cmd.run_all:

salt '*' cmd.run 'ls -l /etc'
The pkg functions automatically map local system package managers to the same salt functions. This means that pkg.install will install packages via yum on Red Hat based systems, apt on Debian systems, etc.:

salt '*' pkg.install vim
Note

Some custom Linux spins and derivatives of other distributions are not properly detected by Salt. If the above command returns an error message saying that pkg.install is not available, then you may need to override the pkg provider. This process is explained here.

The network.interfaces function will list all interfaces on a minion, along with their IP addresses, netmasks, MAC addresses, etc:

salt '*' network.interfaces
CHANGING THE OUTPUT FORMAT
The default output format used for most Salt commands is called the nested outputter, but there are several other outputters that can be used to change the way the output is displayed. For instance, the pprint outputter can be used to display the return data using Python's pprint module:

root@saltmaster:~# salt myminion grains.item pythonpath --out=pprint
{'myminion': {'pythonpath': ['/usr/lib64/python2.7',
                             '/usr/lib/python2.7/plat-linux2',
                             '/usr/lib64/python2.7/lib-tk',
                             '/usr/lib/python2.7/lib-tk',
                             '/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages',
                             '/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/gst-0.10',
                             '/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/gtk-2.0']}}
The full list of Salt outputters, as well as example output, can be found here.

SALT-CALL
The examples so far have described running commands from the Master using the salt command, but when troubleshooting it can be more beneficial to login to the minion directly and use salt-call.

Doing so allows you to see the minion log messages specific to the command you are running (which are not part of the return data you see when running the command from the Master using salt), making it unnecessary to tail the minion log. More information on salt-call and how to use it can be found here.

GRAINS
Salt uses a system called Grains to build up static data about minions. This data includes information about the operating system that is running, CPU architecture and much more. The grains system is used throughout Salt to deliver platform data to many components and to users.

Grains can also be statically set, this makes it easy to assign values to minions for grouping and managing.

A common practice is to assign grains to minions to specify what the role or roles a minion might be. These static grains can be set in the minion configuration file or via the grains.setval function.

TARGETING
Salt allows for minions to be targeted based on a wide range of criteria. The default targeting system uses globular expressions to match minions, hence if there are minions named larry1, larry2, curly1, and curly2, a glob of larry* will match larry1 and larry2, and a glob of *1 will match larry1 and curly1.

Many other targeting systems can be used other than globs, these systems include:

Regular Expressions
Target using PCRE-compliant regular expressions

Grains
Target based on grains data: Targeting with Grains

Pillar
Target based on pillar data: Targeting with Pillar

IP
Target based on IP address/subnet/range

Compound
Create logic to target based on multiple targets: Targeting with Compound

Nodegroup
Target with nodegroups: Targeting with Nodegroup

The concepts of targets are used on the command line with Salt, but also function in many other areas as well, including the state system and the systems used for ACLs and user permissions.

PASSING IN ARGUMENTS
Many of the functions available accept arguments which can be passed in on the command line:

salt '*' pkg.install vim
This example passes the argument vim to the pkg.install function. Since many functions can accept more complex input than just a string, the arguments are parsed through YAML, allowing for more complex data to be sent on the command line:

salt '*' test.echo 'foo: bar'
In this case Salt translates the string 'foo: bar' into the dictionary "{'foo': 'bar'}"

Note

Any line that contains a newline will not be parsed by YAML.

SALT STATES
Now that the basics are covered the time has come to evaluate States. Salt States, or the State System is the component of Salt made for configuration management.

The state system is already available with a basic Salt setup, no additional configuration is required. States can be set up immediately.

Note

Before diving into the state system, a brief overview of how states are constructed will make many of the concepts clearer. Salt states are based on data modeling and build on a low level data structure that is used to execute each state function. Then more logical layers are built on top of each other.

The high layers of the state system which this tutorial will cover consists of everything that needs to be known to use states, the two high layers covered here are the sls layer and the highest layer highstate.

Understanding the layers of data management in the State System will help with understanding states, but they never need to be used. Just as understanding how a compiler functions assists when learning a programming language, understanding what is going on under the hood of a configuration management system will also prove to be a valuable asset.

THE FIRST SLS FORMULA
The state system is built on SLS (SaLt State) formulas. These formulas are built out in files on Salt's file server. To make a very basic SLS formula open up a file under /srv/salt named vim.sls. The following state ensures that vim is installed on a system to which that state has been applied.

/srv/salt/vim.sls:

vim:
  pkg.installed
Now install vim on the minions by calling the SLS directly:

salt '*' state.apply vim
This command will invoke the state system and run the vim SLS.

Now, to beef up the vim SLS formula, a vimrc can be added:

/srv/salt/vim.sls:

vim:
  pkg.installed: []

/etc/vimrc:
  file.managed:
    - source: salt://vimrc
    - mode: 644
    - user: root
    - group: root
Now the desired vimrc needs to be copied into the Salt file server to /srv/salt/vimrc. In Salt, everything is a file, so no path redirection needs to be accounted for. The vimrc file is placed right next to the vim.sls file. The same command as above can be executed to all the vim SLS formulas and now include managing the file.

Note

Salt does not need to be restarted/reloaded or have the master manipulated in any way when changing SLS formulas. They are instantly available.

ADDING SOME DEPTH
Obviously maintaining SLS formulas right in a single directory at the root of the file server will not scale out to reasonably sized deployments. This is why more depth is required. Start by making an nginx formula a better way, make an nginx subdirectory and add an init.sls file:

/srv/salt/nginx/init.sls:

nginx:
  pkg.installed: []
  service.running:
    - require:
      - pkg: nginx
A few concepts are introduced in this SLS formula.

First is the service statement which ensures that the nginx service is running.

Of course, the nginx service can't be started unless the package is installed -- hence the require statement which sets up a dependency between the two.

The require statement makes sure that the required component is executed before and that it results in success.

Note

The require option belongs to a family of options called requisites. Requisites are a powerful component of Salt States, for more information on how requisites work and what is available see: Requisites

Also evaluation ordering is available in Salt as well: Ordering States

This new sls formula has a special name -- init.sls. When an SLS formula is named init.sls it inherits the name of the directory path that contains it. This formula can be referenced via the following command:

salt '*' state.apply nginx
Note

state.apply is just another remote execution function, just like test.version or disk.usage. It simply takes the name of an SLS file as an argument.

Now that subdirectories can be used, the vim.sls formula can be cleaned up. To make things more flexible, move the vim.sls and vimrc into a new subdirectory called edit and change the vim.sls file to reflect the change:

/srv/salt/edit/vim.sls:

vim:
  pkg.installed

/etc/vimrc:
  file.managed:
    - source: salt://edit/vimrc
    - mode: 644
    - user: root
    - group: root
Only the source path to the vimrc file has changed. Now the formula is referenced as edit.vim because it resides in the edit subdirectory. Now the edit subdirectory can contain formulas for emacs, nano, joe or any other editor that may need to be deployed.
