# Pillars

Salt includes a number of built-in external pillars, listed at pillar modules.

The below links contain documentation for the configuration options

    master-side configuration

    minion-side configuration

Note that some of same the configuration options from the master are present in the minion configuration file, these are used in masterless mode.
