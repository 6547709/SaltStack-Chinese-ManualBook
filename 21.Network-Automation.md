# Network Automation - 网络自动化配置

Network automation is a continuous process of automating the configuration, management and operations of a computer network. Although the abstraction could be compared with the operations on the server side, there are many particular challenges, the most important being that a network device is traditionally closed hardware able to run proprietary software only. In other words, the user is not able to install the salt-minion package directly on a traditional network device. For these reasons, most network devices can be controlled only remotely via proxy minions or using the Salt SSH. However, there are also vendors producing whitebox equipment (e.g. Arista, Cumulus) or others that have moved the operating system in the container (e.g. Cisco NX-OS, Cisco IOS-XR), allowing the salt-minion to be installed directly on the platform.
