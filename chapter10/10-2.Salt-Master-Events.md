# Salt Master Events

这些事件在Salt Master事件总线上触发。 不过此列表并不全面。
## Authentication events - 认证事件

**salt/auth**

Minion与master进行认证检查时触发。

Variables
- id -- minion ID.
- act -- minion key的当前状态：`accept`, `pend`, `reject`。
- pub -- minion 公钥

> 注意
>
> Minions出于多种原因会定期触发auth事件。 编写反应器通过auth周期对事件做出响应时会导致无限的反应器事件循环（minion尝试进行auth，反应器通过执行生成另一个auth事件的反应来进行响应，minion发送auth事件，等等）。 建议变更为考虑对`salt/key`或`salt/minion/<MID>/start`做出反应，或者触发自定义事件标签。

## Start events - 启动事件

**salt/minion/<MID>/start**

每当一个minion连接到Salt Master时就被触发。

Variables
- id -- The minion ID.

## Key events - 密钥相关的事件

**salt/key**

    Fired when accepting and rejecting minions keys on the Salt master. These happen as a result of actions undertaken by the salt-key command.

    Variables

            id -- The minion ID.

            act -- The new status of the minion key: accept, delete,

Warning

If a master is in auto_accept mode, salt/key events will not be fired when the keys are accepted. In addition, pre-seeding keys (like happens through Salt-Cloud) will not cause firing of these events.

## Job events

**salt/job/<JID>/new**

    Fired as a new job is sent out to minions.

    Variables

            jid -- The job ID.

            tgt -- The target of the job: *, a minion ID, G@os_family:RedHat, etc.

            tgt_type -- The type of targeting used: glob, grain, compound, etc.

            fun -- The function to run on minions: test.version, network.interfaces, etc.

            arg -- A list of arguments to pass to the function that will be called.

            minions -- A list of minion IDs that Salt expects will return data for this job.

            user -- The name of the user that ran the command as defined in Salt's Publisher ACL or external auth.

**salt/job/<JID>/ret/<MID>**

    Fired each time a minion returns data for a job.

    Variables

            id -- The minion ID.

            jid -- The job ID.

            retcode -- The return code for the job.

            fun -- The function the minion ran. E.g., test.version.

            return -- The data returned from the execution module.

**salt/job/<JID>/prog/<MID>/<RUN NUM>**

    Fired each time a each function in a state run completes execution. Must be enabled using the state_events option.

    Variables

            data -- The data returned from the state module function.

            id -- The minion ID.

            jid -- The job ID.

## Runner Events

**salt/run/<JID>/new**

    Fired as a runner begins execution

    Variables

            jid -- The job ID.

            fun -- The name of the runner function, with runner. prepended to it (e.g. runner.jobs.lookup_jid)

            fun_args -- The arguments passed to the runner function (e.g. ['20160829225914848058'])

            user -- The user who executed the runner (e.g. root)

**salt/run/<JID>/ret**

    Fired when a runner function returns

    Variables

            jid -- The job ID.

            fun -- The name of the runner function, with runner. prepended to it (e.g. runner.jobs.lookup_jid)

            fun_args -- The arguments passed to the runner function (e.g. ['20160829225914848058'])

            return -- The data returned by the runner function

**salt/run/<JID>/args**

    New in version 2016.11.0.

    Fired by the state.orchestrate runner

    Variables

            name -- The ID declaration for the orchestration job (i.e. the line above salt.state, salt.function, salt.runner, etc.)

            type -- The type of orchestration job being run (e.g. state)

            tgt -- The target expression (e.g. \*). Included for state and function types only.

            args -- The args passed to the orchestration job. Note: for state and function types, also includes a tgt_type value which shows what kind of match (glob, pcre, etc.) was used. This value was named expr_form in the 2016.11 release cycle but has been renamed to tgt_type in 2017.7.0 for consistency with other events.

## Presence Events

**salt/presence/present**

    Events fired on a regular interval about currently connected, newly connected, or recently disconnected minions. Requires the presence_events setting to be enabled.

    Variables

        present -- A list of minions that are currently connected to the Salt master.

**salt/presence/change**

    Fired when the Presence system detects new minions connect or disconnect.

    Variables

            new -- A list of minions that have connected since the last presence event.

            lost -- A list of minions that have disconnected since the last presence event.

## Cloud Events

Unlike other Master events, salt-cloud events are not fired on behalf of a Salt Minion. Instead, salt-cloud events are fired on behalf of a VM. This is because the minion-to-be may not yet exist to fire events to or also may have been destroyed.

This behavior is reflected by the name variable in the event data for salt-cloud events as compared to the id variable for Salt Minion-triggered events.
