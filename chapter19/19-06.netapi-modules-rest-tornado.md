# rest_tornado

## A non-blocking REST API for Salt

**依赖关系**

  - tornado Python module

**配置方法**

所有身份验证均通过Salt的 [external auth](https://github.com/watermelonbig/SaltStack-Chinese-ManualBook/blob/master/chapter04/04-6-1.Publish-acl-external-auth-peer-communication.md#EXTERNAL-AUTHENTICATION-SYSTEM) 外部身份验证系统完成，该系统需要此处未介绍的一些其他配置支持。

为了用salt-master运行rest_tornado，需要将以下内容添加到Salt master配置文件中。
```YAML
rest_tornado:
    # can be any port
    port: 8000
    # address to bind to (defaults to 0.0.0.0)
    address: 0.0.0.0
    # socket backlog
    backlog: 128
    ssl_crt: /etc/pki/api/certs/server.crt
    # no need to specify ssl_key if cert and key
    # are in one single file
    ssl_key: /etc/pki/api/certs/server.key
    debug: False
    disable_ssl: False
    webhook_disable_auth: False
    cors_origin: null
```

### Authentication - 身份认证

通过在发送访问请求时传递一个session token来执行认证。 令牌是通过`SaltAuthHandler` URL生成的。

令牌可以通过以下两种方式之一发送：
  - 包含一个名为 `X-Auth-Token` 的自定义header。
  - 通过Cookie发送。 对于自动处理cookie支持的HTTP客户端（例如浏览器），此选项很方便。

> See also：您可以通过`RunSaltAPIHandler` URL绕过会话处理。


### CORS - 跨站点请求

rest_tornado支持开箱即用的跨站点HTTP请求。 默认情况下，它是由`cors_origin`配置键禁用和控制的。

通过将`cors_origin`设置为`*`，可以允许所有源的访问请求。

使用下面这个配置，您只能允许一个来源：
```YAML
rest_tornado:
    cors_origin: http://salt.yourcompany.com
```
您还可以更具体一些，并使用列表仅选择一些允许的来源。 例如：
```YAML
rest_tornado:
    cors_origin:
        - http://salt.yourcompany.com
        - http://salt-preprod.yourcampany.com
```

来源的格式为完整URL，如果不是标准格式，则包含scheme和端口。

在这种情况下，rest_tornado将在允许的情况下检查Origin报头是否在允许的列表中。 否则，它将不返回任何内容，从而有效地阻止了源发送的请求。

作为参考，CORS是浏览器使用的一种机制，用于允许（或禁止）来自浏览器的请求来自与salt-api不同的来源。 仅当您计划使用作为Javascript浏览器应用程序开发的Salt客户端时，它才是Authentication的补充和强制性要求。

### Usage - 使用方法

Commands are sent to a running Salt master via this module by sending HTTP requests to the URLs detailed below.

Content negotiation

This REST interface is flexible in what data formats it will accept as well as what formats it will return (e.g., JSON, YAML, x-www-form-urlencoded).

    Specify the format of data in the request body by including the Content-Type header.

    Specify the desired data format for the response body with the Accept header.

Data sent in POST and PUT requests must be in the format of a list of lowstate dictionaries. This allows multiple commands to be executed in a single HTTP request.

lowstate

    A dictionary containing various keys that instruct Salt which command to run, where that command lives, any parameters for that command, any authentication credentials, what returner to use, etc.

    Salt uses the lowstate data format internally in many places to pass command data between functions. Salt also uses lowstate for the LocalClient() Python API interface.

The following example (in JSON format) causes Salt to execute two commands:

[{
    "client": "local",
    "tgt": "*",
    "fun": "test.fib",
    "arg": ["10"]
},
{
    "client": "runner",
    "fun": "jobs.lookup_jid",
    "jid": "20130603122505459265"
}]

Multiple commands in a Salt API request will be executed in serial and makes no gaurantees that all commands will run. Meaning that if test.fib (from the example above) had an exception, the API would still execute "jobs.lookup_jid".

Responses to these lowstates are an in-order list of dicts containing the return data, a yaml response could look like:

- ms-1: true
  ms-2: true
- ms-1: foo
  ms-2: bar

In the event of an exception while executing a command the return for that lowstate will be a string, for example if no minions matched the first lowstate we would get a return like:

- No minions matched the target. No command was sent, no jid was assigned.
- ms-1: true
  ms-2: true

x-www-form-urlencoded

Sending JSON or YAML in the request body is simple and most flexible, however sending data in urlencoded format is also supported with the caveats below. It is the default format for HTML forms, many JavaScript libraries, and the curl command.

For example, the equivalent to running salt '*' test.ping is sending fun=test.ping&arg&client=local&tgt=* in the HTTP request body.

Caveats:

    Only a single command may be sent per HTTP request.

    Repeating the arg parameter multiple times will cause those parameters to be combined into a single list.

    Note, some popular frameworks and languages (notably jQuery, PHP, and Ruby on Rails) will automatically append empty brackets onto repeated parameters. E.g., arg=one, arg=two will be sent as arg[]=one, arg[]=two. This is not supported; send JSON or YAML instead.

A Websockets add-on to saltnado

depends

        tornado Python module

In order to enable saltnado_websockets you must add websockets: True to your saltnado config block.

rest_tornado:
    # can be any port
    port: 8000
    ssl_crt: /etc/pki/api/certs/server.crt
    # no need to specify ssl_key if cert and key
    # are in one single file
    ssl_key: /etc/pki/api/certs/server.key
    debug: False
    disable_ssl: False
    websockets: True

All Events

Exposes all "real-time" events from Salt's event bus on a websocket connection. It should be noted that "Real-time" here means these events are made available to the server as soon as any salt related action (changes to minions, new jobs etc) happens. Clients are however assumed to be able to tolerate any network transport related latencies. Functionality provided by this endpoint is similar to the /events end point.

The event bus on the Salt master exposes a large variety of things, notably when executions are started on the master and also when minions ultimately return their results. This URL provides a real-time window into a running Salt infrastructure. Uses websocket as the transport mechanism.

Exposes GET method to return websocket connections. All requests should include an auth token. A way to obtain obtain authentication tokens is shown below.

% curl -si localhost:8000/login \
    -H "Accept: application/json" \
    -d username='salt' \
    -d password='salt' \
    -d eauth='pam'

Which results in the response

{
    "return": [{
        "perms": [".*", "@runner", "@wheel"],
        "start": 1400556492.277421,
        "token": "d0ce6c1a37e99dcc0374392f272fe19c0090cca7",
        "expire": 1400599692.277422,
        "user": "salt",
        "eauth": "pam"
    }]
}

In this example the token returned is d0ce6c1a37e99dcc0374392f272fe19c0090cca7 and can be included in subsequent websocket requests (as part of the URL).

The event stream can be easily consumed via JavaScript:

// Note, you must be authenticated!

// Get the Websocket connection to Salt
var source = new Websocket('wss://localhost:8000/all_events/d0ce6c1a37e99dcc0374392f272fe19c0090cca7');

// Get Salt's "real time" event stream.
source.onopen = function() { source.send('websocket client ready'); };

// Other handlers
source.onerror = function(e) { console.debug('error!', e); };

// e.data represents Salt's "real time" event data as serialized JSON.
source.onmessage = function(e) { console.debug(e.data); };

// Terminates websocket connection and Salt's "real time" event stream on the server.
source.close();

Or via Python, using the Python module websocket-client for example. Or the tornado client.

# Note, you must be authenticated!

from websocket import create_connection

# Get the Websocket connection to Salt
ws = create_connection('wss://localhost:8000/all_events/d0ce6c1a37e99dcc0374392f272fe19c0090cca7')

# Get Salt's "real time" event stream.
ws.send('websocket client ready')


# Simple listener to print results of Salt's "real time" event stream.
# Look at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/websocket-client/ for more examples.
while listening_to_events:
    print ws.recv()       #  Salt's "real time" event data as serialized JSON.

# Terminates websocket connection and Salt's "real time" event stream on the server.
ws.close()

# Please refer to https://github.com/liris/websocket-client/issues/81 when using a self signed cert

Above examples show how to establish a websocket connection to Salt and activating real time updates from Salt's event stream by signaling websocket client ready.
Formatted Events

Exposes formatted "real-time" events from Salt's event bus on a websocket connection. It should be noted that "Real-time" here means these events are made available to the server as soon as any salt related action (changes to minions, new jobs etc) happens. Clients are however assumed to be able to tolerate any network transport related latencies. Functionality provided by this endpoint is similar to the /events end point.

The event bus on the Salt master exposes a large variety of things, notably when executions are started on the master and also when minions ultimately return their results. This URL provides a real-time window into a running Salt infrastructure. Uses websocket as the transport mechanism.

Formatted events parses the raw "real time" event stream and maintains a current view of the following:

    minions

    jobs

A change to the minions (such as addition, removal of keys or connection drops) or jobs is processed and clients are updated. Since we use salt's presence events to track minions, please enable presence_events and set a small value for the loop_interval in the salt master config file.

Exposes GET method to return websocket connections. All requests should include an auth token. A way to obtain obtain authentication tokens is shown below.

% curl -si localhost:8000/login \
    -H "Accept: application/json" \
    -d username='salt' \
    -d password='salt' \
    -d eauth='pam'

Which results in the response

{
    "return": [{
        "perms": [".*", "@runner", "@wheel"],
        "start": 1400556492.277421,
        "token": "d0ce6c1a37e99dcc0374392f272fe19c0090cca7",
        "expire": 1400599692.277422,
        "user": "salt",
        "eauth": "pam"
    }]
}

In this example the token returned is d0ce6c1a37e99dcc0374392f272fe19c0090cca7 and can be included in subsequent websocket requests (as part of the URL).

The event stream can be easily consumed via JavaScript:

// Note, you must be authenticated!

// Get the Websocket connection to Salt
var source = new Websocket('wss://localhost:8000/formatted_events/d0ce6c1a37e99dcc0374392f272fe19c0090cca7');

// Get Salt's "real time" event stream.
source.onopen = function() { source.send('websocket client ready'); };

Example responses

Minion information is a dictionary keyed by each connected minion's id (mid), grains information for each minion is also included.

Minion information is sent in response to the following minion events:

    connection drops

            requires running manage.present periodically every loop_interval seconds

    minion addition

    minon removal

# Not all grains are shown
data: {
    "minions": {
        "minion1": {
            "id": "minion1",
            "grains": {
                "kernel": "Darwin",
                "domain": "local",
                "zmqversion": "4.0.3",
                "kernelrelease": "13.2.0"
            }
        }
    }
}

Job information is also tracked and delivered.

Job information is also a dictionary in which each job's information is keyed by salt's jid.

data: {
    "jobs": {
        "20140609153646699137": {
            "tgt_type": "glob",
            "jid": "20140609153646699137",
            "tgt": "*",
            "start_time": "2014-06-09T15:36:46.700315",
            "state": "complete",
            "fun": "test.ping",
            "minions": {
                "minion1": {
                    "return": true,
                    "retcode": 0,
                    "success": true
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
