# Salt SSH
Execute salt commands and states over ssh without installing a salt-minion.


## Getting Started

Salt SSH is very easy to use, simply set up a basic roster file of the systems to connect to and run salt-ssh commands in a similar way as standard salt commands.

    Salt ssh is considered production ready in version 2014.7.0

    Python is required on the remote system (unless using the -r option to send raw ssh commands)

    On many systems, the salt-ssh executable will be in its own package, usually named salt-ssh

    The Salt SSH system does not supersede the standard Salt communication systems, it simply offers an SSH-based alternative that does not require ZeroMQ and a remote agent. Be aware that since all communication with Salt SSH is executed via SSH it is substantially slower than standard Salt with ZeroMQ.

    At the moment fileserver operations must be wrapped to ensure that the relevant files are delivered with the salt-ssh commands. The state module is an exception, which compiles the state run on the master, and in the process finds all the references to salt:// paths and copies those files down in the same tarball as the state run. However, needed fileserver wrappers are still under development.

## Salt SSH Roster

The roster system in Salt allows for remote minions to be easily defined.

Note

See the SSH roster docs for more details.

Simply create the roster file, the default location is /etc/salt/roster:
```yaml
web1: 192.168.42.1
```
This is a very basic roster file where a Salt ID is being assigned to an IP address. A more elaborate roster can be created:
```yaml
web1:
  host: 192.168.42.1 # The IP addr or DNS hostname
  user: fred         # Remote executions will be executed as user fred
  passwd: foobarbaz  # The password to use for login, if omitted, keys are used
  sudo: True         # Whether to sudo to root, not enabled by default
web2:
  host: 192.168.42.2
```
Note

sudo works only if NOPASSWD is set for user in /etc/sudoers: fred ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
Deploy ssh key for salt-ssh

By default, salt-ssh will generate key pairs for ssh, the default path will be /etc/salt/pki/master/ssh/salt-ssh.rsa. The key generation happens when you run salt-ssh for the first time.

You can use ssh-copy-id, (the OpenSSH key deployment tool) to deploy keys to your servers.
```yaml
ssh-copy-id -i /etc/salt/pki/master/ssh/salt-ssh.rsa.pub user@server.demo.com
```
One could also create a simple shell script, named salt-ssh-copy-id.sh as follows:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
if [ -z $1 ]; then
   echo $0 user@host.com
   exit 0
fi
ssh-copy-id -i /etc/salt/pki/master/ssh/salt-ssh.rsa.pub $1
```
Note

Be certain to chmod +x salt-ssh-copy-id.sh.
```bash
./salt-ssh-copy-id.sh user@server1.host.com
./salt-ssh-copy-id.sh user@server2.host.com
```
Once keys are successfully deployed, salt-ssh can be used to control them.

Alternatively ssh agent forwarding can be used by setting the priv to agent-forwarding.

## Calling Salt SSH

Note

salt-ssh on RHEL/CentOS 5

The salt-ssh command requires at least python 2.6, which is not installed by default on RHEL/CentOS 5. An easy workaround in this situation is to use the -r option to run a raw shell command that installs python26:
```bash
salt-ssh centos-5-minion -r 'yum -y install epel-release ; yum -y install python26'
```
Note

salt-ssh on systems with Python 3.x

Salt, before the 2017.7.0 release, does not support Python 3.x which is the default on for example the popular 16.04 LTS release of Ubuntu. An easy workaround for this scenario is to use the -r option similar to the example above:
```bash
salt-ssh ubuntu-1604-minion -r 'apt update ; apt install -y python-minimal'
```
The salt-ssh command can be easily executed in the same way as a salt command:
```bash
salt-ssh '*' test.version
```
Commands with salt-ssh follow the same syntax as the salt command.

The standard salt functions are available! The output is the same as salt and many of the same flags are available. Please see http://docs.saltstack.com/ref/cli/salt-ssh.html for all of the available options.
Raw Shell Calls

By default salt-ssh runs Salt execution modules on the remote system, but salt-ssh can also execute raw shell commands:
```bash
salt-ssh '*' -r 'ifconfig'
```
## States Via Salt SSH

The Salt State system can also be used with salt-ssh. The state system abstracts the same interface to the user in salt-ssh as it does when using standard salt. The intent is that Salt Formulas defined for standard salt will work seamlessly with salt-ssh and vice-versa.

The standard Salt States walkthroughs function by simply replacing salt commands with salt-ssh.
## Targeting with Salt SSH

Due to the fact that the targeting approach differs in salt-ssh, only glob and regex targets are supported as of this writing, the remaining target systems still need to be implemented.

Note

By default, Grains are settable through salt-ssh. By default, these grains will not be persisted across reboots.

See the "thin_dir" setting in Roster documentation for more details.
## Configuring Salt SSH

Salt SSH takes its configuration from a master configuration file. Normally, this file is in /etc/salt/master. If one wishes to use a customized configuration file, the -c option to Salt SSH facilitates passing in a directory to look inside for a configuration file named master.
Minion Config

New in version 2015.5.1.

Minion config options can be defined globally using the master configuration option ssh_minion_opts. It can also be defined on a per-minion basis with the minion_opts entry in the roster.
## Running Salt SSH as non-root user

By default, Salt read all the configuration from /etc/salt/. If you are running Salt SSH with a regular user you have to modify some paths or you will get "Permission denied" messages. You have to modify two parameters: pki_dir and cachedir. Those should point to a full path writable for the user.

It's recommended not to modify /etc/salt for this purpose. Create a private copy of /etc/salt for the user and run the command with -c /new/config/path.
## Define CLI Options with Saltfile

If you are commonly passing in CLI options to salt-ssh, you can create a Saltfile to automatically use these options. This is common if you're managing several different salt projects on the same server.

So you can cd into a directory that has a Saltfile with the following YAML contents:
```yaml
salt-ssh:
  config_dir: path/to/config/dir
  ssh_log_file: salt-ssh.log
  ssh_max_procs: 30
  ssh_wipe: True
```
Instead of having to call salt-ssh --config-dir=path/to/config/dir --max-procs=30 --wipe \* test.version you can call salt-ssh \* test.version.

Boolean-style options should be specified in their YAML representation.

Note

The option keys specified must match the destination attributes for the options specified in the parser salt.utils.parsers.SaltSSHOptionParser. For example, in the case of the --wipe command line option, its dest is configured to be ssh_wipe and thus this is what should be configured in the Saltfile. Using the names of flags for this option, being wipe: True or w: True, will not work.

Note

For the Saltfile to be automatically detected it needs to be named Saltfile with a capital S and be readable by the user running salt-ssh.

At last you can create ~/.salt/Saltfile and salt-ssh will automatically load it by default.

## Debugging salt-ssh

One common approach for debugging salt-ssh is to simply use the tarball that salt ships to the remote machine and call salt-call directly.

To determine the location of salt-call, simply run salt-ssh with the -ltrace flag and look for a line containing the string, SALT_ARGV. This contains the salt-call command that salt-ssh attempted to execute.

It is recommended that one modify this command a bit by removing the -l quiet, --metadata and --output json to get a better idea of what's going on the target system.

### Salt Rosters

Salt rosters are pluggable systems added in Salt 0.17.0 to facilitate the salt-ssh system. The roster system was created because salt-ssh needs a means to identify which systems need to be targeted for execution.

roster modules

Note

The Roster System is not needed or used in standard Salt because the master does not need to be initially aware of target systems, since the Salt Minion checks itself into the master.

Since the roster system is pluggable, it can be easily augmented to attach to any existing systems to gather information about what servers are presently available and should be attached to by salt-ssh. By default the roster file is located at /etc/salt/roster.
#### How Rosters Work

The roster system compiles a data structure internally referred to as targets. The targets is a list of target systems and attributes about how to connect to said systems. The only requirement for a roster module in Salt is to return the targets data structure.

**Targets Data**

The information which can be stored in a roster target is the following:

<Salt ID>:       # The id to reference the target system with
    host:        # The IP address or DNS name of the remote host
    user:        # The user to log in as
    passwd:      # The password to log in with

    # Optional parameters
    port:        # The target system's ssh port number
    sudo:        # Boolean to run command via sudo
    sudo_user:   # Str: Set this to execute Salt as a sudo user other than root.
                 # This user must be in the same system group as the remote user
                 # that is used to login and is specified above. Alternatively,
                 # the user must be a super-user.
    tty:         # Boolean: Set this option to True if sudo is also set to
                 # True and requiretty is also set on the target system
    priv:        # File path to ssh private key, defaults to salt-ssh.rsa
                 # The priv can also be set to agent-forwarding to not specify
                 # a key, but use ssh agent forwarding
    priv_passwd: # Passphrase for ssh private key
    timeout:     # Number of seconds to wait for response when establishing
                 # an SSH connection
    minion_opts: # Dictionary of minion opts
    thin_dir:    # The target system's storage directory for Salt
                 # components. Defaults to /tmp/salt-<hash>.
    cmd_umask:   # umask to enforce for the salt-call command. Should be in
                 # octal (so for 0o077 in YAML you would do 0077, or 63)

**Target Defaults**

The roster_defaults dictionary in the master config is used to set the default login variables for minions in the roster so that the same arguments do not need to be passed with commandline arguments.

roster_defaults:
  user: daniel
  sudo: True
  priv: /root/.ssh/id_rsa
  tty: True

**thin_dir**

Salt needs to upload a standalone environment to the target system, and this defaults to /tmp/salt-<hash>. This directory will be cleaned up per normal systems operation.

If you need a persistent Salt environment, for instance to set persistent grains, this value will need to be changed.
